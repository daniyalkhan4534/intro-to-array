# intro-to-array

An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. 
This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array 

Sum of an array:- is defined as the sum of all elements present in the array.

Algorithm for the program:-

1.Take n,a variable that stores the number of elements of the array.

2.Create an array of size n

3.Iterate via for loop to take array elements as input and print them.

4.Iterate via for loop to access each elements of array to get the sum of all the elements.

5.Print the sum of an array
